The items in this directory of origin/master is deployed via GitHub pages.

Note: The website is open-source. The app itself is closed-source.

## Running the site locally

GitHub pages uses Jekyll, which is a static site generator. It essentially turns the markdowns in this directory into a nice looking website.

Follow [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll on your computer.

Then, in **this directory**, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The console should give you a link to visit. Just visit that link in your web browser!

Feel free to explore the website. There's some interesting legal docs...
